April 2021. More than one year has passed since
this Corona nightmare put all our lives upside down
and things are only slowly changing
for the better in Europe.
Hopefully on the verge of a turning point for travel
restrictions within the EU thanks to the vaccination
campaign, everyone in Germany is looking forward to travelling abroad
again safely and we follow closer than ever the current restrictions
applying to foreign countries near and far.

That is the moment we saw
the need of a friendly and automated interface to the meticulous and ever-changing
designations of the German authorities on the topic.
And not only out of compassion for our beloved citizens
in the Federal Republic of Germany, but also because the travel restrictions
to and from Germany directly affect us, the developers of the Corona Atlas Website.

Our names are Diego and Rodrigo. We are two Spanish brothers;
Diego still lives in Spain while Rodrigo has been based
in Germany for the last half decade.
We yearn for the pre-corona times where EU-borders did not exist
and cannot wait for the moment we will be able to have
uncomplicated family meetings again with as few bureaucracy and
as much safety as possible. Until that becomes a reality,
we have learned that a good coding project can keep us
united in the distance.

Whether it is _Heimweh_ or _Fernweh_ what brought you here,
we want you to help you count down the days until
your next big journey. Stay safe.

Diego is an **R** geek and he is all about data

the map visualization of Corona Atlas
and its underlying design based on
his very own template,
[Chulapa](https://dieghernan.github.io/chulapa/).

The younger brother prefers to entertain himself
with **Python**, which serves him very well to play around in
business and private matters with signal processing,
artificial intelligence and nerdy math in general.
Apart from reaching out Diego with the project's idea,
Rodrigo has dedicated his efforts to scrap the data
off the RKI website.
Oh, he is also the one to blame if the German text
_spanisch vorkommt_ in some places.

Rodrigo also has a personal website where he
explores some of his scientific interests
and their connection to art:
